        space. With Passageway, users are able to see heat maps and view graphs that represent the foot traffic in a building,
        and analyze it on a website with various building floor-plans layered onto a Google Map. Users may also specify a
        certain time frame to see specific temporal data. All of the data is collected within the facilities through a system
        including CHIP computers connected to a pair of Infrared break beams. Ultimately, the data may be used to determine
        the frequency of activity for specific rooms, hallways, or entryways. Foot traffic data may be useful for understanding
        activity within a facility, seeing popularity of certain areas during specific times, or identifying times where
        room capacity is exceeded and thus presents a fire code violation. This was also published in the Consortium for
        Computing Sciences in Colleges academic journal.`,

        The design tries to follow Google's Material Design guidelines as best as possible, which makes it look as clean
        as it does. There are no advertisements or obnoxious elements that hamper the user experience for what should be
        a simple web application. The Web app is built using Ember.js, a very robust Javascript framework. All of the movie
        information is pulled from TheMovieDB via their API. Movie ratings from 3rd party services are pulled from the OMDb
        API. User authentication and ratings are stored using Google's Firebase real-time database. The only personal information
        stored is the user's email, of which is not visible to others and is not shared by CineR8 anywhere. I know that there
        are bigger and arguably better services that do the same thing as CineR8. My motivation behind creating this web
        application was mainly to learn Ember.js, but I also wanted something simpler than the well-known services. I think
        that I acheived both goals and look forward to what this project will become over time.`,
