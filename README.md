## About
This website is the personal site of Jaxon Wright, a software developer in the Grand Rapids, Michigan Area. It is written with the Angular framework. It is meant to showcase a little about Jaxon and what I he's been working on. Feel free to reference any of this for your own project or even fork the repository.

## Libraries Used
This is not an exhaustive list, but it is the core of what is used.
- [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) : The backbone
- [Angular Material](https://github.com/angular/components) : Provides a plethora of elements that follow Google's Material 3 design standard
- [Angular FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) : A very powerful, fast and light way to handle icons.

## Testing, Building and Deploying
If you are starting fresh, make sure to run `npm install` to grab all of the dependencies

### Testing
To start up the local development server, simply run `ng serve`

### Building
This is a script defined in the package.json. You may want to change the base-href in that command to not be at the root domain path.

`npm run build`


### Deploying
Deployment is automatically ran by Cloudflare Pages when the `master` branch has changes pushed to it.


### License
This project uses the MIT license, which basically means you can do whatever you want with it. All that I ask is that you don't use it to deploy a portfolio website pretending to be me...
